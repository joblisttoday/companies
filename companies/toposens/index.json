    "description": "Toposens developed the first 3D ultrasound sensor worldwide. The sensor system perceives its environment via the principle of echolocation, similar to a bat.  We are developing a completely new method of localizing 3D positions through ultrasound for the precise 3D detection of objects in real-time. Our know-how lies in the design of sophisticated algorithms, which are embedded in the sensor system. Thereby we enable autonomous vehicles and robots to perceive their short-range environment in difficult and unstructured environments. The sensor system of Toposens generates new ways of providing non-optical vision to machines to simplify and transform our interaction with technology and make the transportation of tomorrow smarter and more efficient.",
