  Smartlane GmbH, founded in 2015, is a Munich-based software company that
  developed Smartlane Transport Intelligence, an AI-based software for transport
  optimization in logistics. Smartlane is backed by innovative investors, first
  and foremost Frank Thelen with his VC company Freigeist. Based on many years
  of research by the founders at the Technical University of Munich, Smartlane
  Transport Intelligence enables the gradual digitalization and automation of
  transport planning (dispatching). For the first time, the self-learning
  cloud-based technology reduces dispatching efforts by up to 90% as well as
  resource requirements, operational costs and CO2 emissions by up to 21%.
  Customers include numerous medium-sized general cargo forwarders, including
  several network partners of the Cargoline association.
