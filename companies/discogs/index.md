description: Discogs (short for discographies) is a database of information
  about audio recordings, including commercial releases, promotional releases,
  and bootleg or off-label releases. Database contents are user-generated, and
  described in The New York Times as "Wikipedia-like". While the site was
  originally created with the goal of becoming the largest online database of
  electronic music, it now includes releases in all genres and on all formats as
  well as a music market place.
