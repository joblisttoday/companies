  Until now, errors were the main barrier to useful quantum computers. Our
  self-correcting quantum bits enable fault-tolerant quantum computing and can
  run any quantum algorithm. We aim to dramatically increase our computing power
  to tackle your toughest challenges. Now, what would you do with exponential
  computing power?  We are a spin-off from the ENS Paris and ENS de Lyon based
  in Paris, France.
