    "description": "We’ve always been fascinated by human intelligence – it shaped the modern world we live in today.   Intelligence allows us to learn, imagine, cooperate, create, communicate, and so much more. By better understanding different aspects of intelligence, we can use this knowledge as inspiration to build novel computer systems that learn to find solutions to difficult problems on their own. We research and build safe artificial intelligence systems. Our goal is to solve intelligence and advance scientific discovery for all.",
