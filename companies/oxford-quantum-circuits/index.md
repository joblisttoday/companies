  Quantum computers are a new generation of problem solving machines. They are
  not just very small (or faster, or better) computers – rather, they operate
  according to completely new rules. This new kind of computing will make
  entirely new forms of information processing possible.  What we’re talking
  about is a paradigm shift – the quantum shift. Whilst we can’t predict its
  exact ramifications, we know that its results will be revolutionary,
  far-reaching and incredibly lucrative for some. Current estimates of the
  quantum market’s future vary, but some anticipate an overall market of $10bn
  within the next five years (BCG).  Quantum computers will allow our customers
  to streamline their businesses, trailblaze new approaches, and solve some of
  humanity’s greatest problems, from slowing down climate changes to feeding a
  rapidly growing population.
