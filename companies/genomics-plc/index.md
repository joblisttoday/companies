description: >-
  We're a world-leader in genomic prevention: a paradigm-changing approach to
  sustainable healthcare which for the first time allows reliable, personalized
  estimates of risk for all the common diseases and cancers, well ahead of
  disease manifestation, allowing accurate and early interventions and tailored
  screening.     Our proprietary algorithms and databases offer something no
  competitor can: the ability to accurately link minute variation across the
  entire genome to changes in thousands of biological measurements and disease
  outcomes, to generate population-level insights for healthcare systems,
  individual-level insights for clinicians about the risk of common diseases,
  and new understanding of disease processes.
