We believe that people should have access to the conversations, moments and ideas they care most about, no matter where they are.  Through our highly scalable platform, participants are able to learn, engage, and connect from anywhere in the world.Â Hopin started as a virtual events solution but we have since meaningfully expanded our offering from virtual events to hybrid and in-person events, as well as video and workplace collaboration products.",
