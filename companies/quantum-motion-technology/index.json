    "description": "The development of a fault tolerant quantum processor will open up possibilities far beyond the reach of todayâ€™s small quantum computers and even the emerging noisy intermediate scale quantum processors (NISQs). This technology will power high-impact applications in areas vital for human progress in the 21st century: in-software discovery of new chemicals, materials and drugs; the reduction of wastage through optimisation of resource usage; and enabling new models for AI and machine learning.  Our goal is to fast-track the development of true fault tolerant quantum computers and reach one million qubits and beyond by leveraging existing knowledge in device fabrication within the trillion-dollar silicon industry.",
