  We’re leaders in an open-source movement bigger than ourselves and we’ve been
  on the same mission for over a decade, since our co-founder Lorenz Meier
  created Pixhawk, MAVLink, QGC, and PX4 (the world’s most widely used
  open-source drone autopilot operating system). Our mission is to be the drone
  platform of choice for enterprise, government, and drone manufacturers while
  accelerating the drone industry by driving forward open standards to create a
  common, future-proof roadmap in a thriving, open ecosystem of buyers and
  vendors.  At Auterion, we bring together the sharpest minds who love to solve
  the hardest problems. Join a vibrant team built on innovation, openness, and
  excellence, where you’ll be empowered to develop ideas, collaborate across all
  levels, and make an impact that matters.
