  Our scientists and engineers are working with partners around the globe on the
  technology for fusion power stations, and we are a world leader in the race to
  bring it to the electricity grid.  A new Â£220M design project led by UKAEA
  could see the first fusion powerplant built in the UK by 2040. To enable this,
  we have created a set of research facilities tackling the big challenges on
  the path to commercial fusion energy.
