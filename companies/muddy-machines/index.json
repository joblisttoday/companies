    "description": "Britain requires 80,000 migrant workers every year during harvest season. Crops that need to be selectively harvested are particularly labour intensive because you need to carefully assess each plant to see if it/it's crop is ready for harvest and most of the time you also cannot simply rip out the plant but rather have to carefully remove the bit that you want to harvest.   We are developing a new generation of field robots that help growers manage labour-intensive crops by conducting fieldwork. Initially, we are focused on developing selective harvesters with yield prediction. Our machines will enable growers to grow more produce locally and ensure that the food we eat is fresher, more sustainable and resilient to future disruption in trade and labour.",
