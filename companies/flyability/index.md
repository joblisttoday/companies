  Flyability is a Swiss company building safe drones for inaccessible places. By
  allowing drones to be used safely inside cities, inside buildings, and in
  contact with people, it enables new interactions and services with UAVs and
  solving the two most critical issues of one of the fastest growing industries:
  collision and injury risks.  The companyâ€™s first market is in industrial
  inspection where it avoids sending people in dangerous and confined spaces for
  the inspection of Energy, Oil & Gas or transport infrastructure. It is also
  active in Search & Rescue and security to assess emergency situations without
  putting humans at risk.
