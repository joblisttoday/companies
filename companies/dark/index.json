    "description": "Accessing space is mainly a question of physics. Still, incumbents have the infrastructure and knowledge to do it consistently and well. That’s forced new space projects into a difficult competition to cut costs and increase availability. In the end, this focus has created solutions that are neither better or worse, but equivalent. True leaps forward often come from features such as availability or proximity that can’t be easily compared to technical performance.",
