  In addition to the platform itself, the turnkey solution includes sustainable
  trucks from leading OEMs, their seamless integration into existing logistics
  processes, and their remote, reliable operation under customized
  "as-a-service" agreements. This means that logistics customers, which include
  DB Schenker or Volkswagen Group Logistics, can take the next step in
  automating their processes today.  Fernride was spun out in 2019 by Hendrik
  Kramer, Dr. Maximilian Fisser and Jean-Michael Georg after ten years of
  research at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and quickly attracted
  venture capital (>â‚¬10M 2021), customers and talents - becoming a European
  technology champion.
