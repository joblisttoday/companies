    "description": "Construction impacts our daily lives in unique ways. The industry shapes the cities we live in, producing the homes we dwell in and the infrastructure that drives our economies.  With 200,000 people a day globally moving to urban areas, the industry must respond to some of the biggest challenges of our time, but it is plagued by waste and inefficiency.  This is why we are building the next generation of tools that help reduce costs and prevent costly overruns, to keep projects on track and on schedule.",
