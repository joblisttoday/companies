    "description": "We tease the highest possible performance out of quantum software to reach quantum advantage sooner. By making Riverlane’s software portable across technologies, early adopters don’t need to choose which technology to pursue.We go deep into the stack so that our hardware partners can focus on the physics and build better full-stack solutions. We work with the chemical, pharmaceutical and materials industries to improve algorithms and specify early killer applications of quantum computers.",
