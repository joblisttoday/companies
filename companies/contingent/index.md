  Contingent was conceived, designed and built by a team of financial risk
  technology veterans and AI researchers operating at the bleeding edge of
  Supply Chain Risk, Data, and Computer Science and Compliance/Due
  Diligence/Screening Risk.  The result: we have built the worldâ€™s first SaaS
  product that provides a quick, complete, up-to-date analysis of suppliers and
  businesses, thereby helping firms comply with regulation, de-risk exposure and
  outwit fraudsters.
