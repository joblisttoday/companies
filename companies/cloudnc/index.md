  We thrive on some of the world’s most complex problems and are developing
  ground-breaking software that combines diverse fields of computer science in a
  way that has never been done before.  We’re pioneering techniques that
  optimise and autonomise factory production – sparking a sustainable industrial
  revolution that transforms how the world is made. Our technology is already
  autonomising CNC machines. We’re streamlining expensive and slow processes,
  minimising human error and optimising machining strategies from millions of
  potential variables to improve quality and speed up delivery times.
