    "description": "Volocopter is building the world’s first sustainable and scalable urban air mobility business to bring affordable air taxi services to megacities worldwide. With a multi-range and multipurpose aircraft portfolio, Volocopter is developing the first eVTOL family of aircraft (VoloCity, VoloConnect, and VoloDrone) to provide complete, safe, and quiet urban mobility coverage for passengers and logistics.  Volocopter leads and cooperates with partners in infrastructure, operations, and air traffic management to build the ecosystem necessary to ‘Bring Urban Air Mobility to Life’. In 2011, Volocopter performed the first-ever crewed flight of a purely electric multicopter and has since showcased numerous public flights with its full-scale aircraft— including notable public test flights at Singapore’s Marina Bay in October 2019 and the world’s first autonomous eVTOL flight in Dubai 2017.",
