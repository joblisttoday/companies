  Plantix is the world’s most downloaded app for farmers - combining artificial
  intelligence and the expertise of leading research institutions around the
  globe. Millions of customers use Plantix in order to identify diseases and
  nutrient deficiencies affecting their crops. Thanks to our unparalleled image
  recognition, farmers are able to obtain an accurate diagnosis and impartial
  prescriptions of helpful products for the first time in their farming life.
  This in combination with good agricultural advice helps farmers to optimize
  pesticide and fertilizer use, and thus produce more, spend less and protect
  their environments.  Yet we don’t stop here. As retail-shops often sell wrong,
  bad and fake products to farmers, we simply included them in our ecosystem.
  Through Plantix, retailers get fresh customers with precise prescriptions, can
  order good quality products like plant protection, seeds, and fertilizers at a
  fair price and professionalize their business.  On top of that, the
  unprecedented real-time data that is generated through Plantix is helping to
  improve the entire value chain, from production to distribution of
  agri-inputs.
