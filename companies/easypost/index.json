    "description": "Founded in 2012, EasyPost is a YC unicorn whose mission is to make shipping simple for businesses, from garage startups to the Fortune 500. Shipping, now more than ever, is the backbone of the global economy, but integrating the technology-enabled operations of a modern business with the low-tech and complex shipping industry has always been a challenge. EasyPost solves this problem with the first developer-friendly REST API for shipping, and we continue to push boundaries and discover new ways to simplify shipping for all.",
