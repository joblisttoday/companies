  Utilizing an intelligent Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV), Perceptual Robotics
  provides existing inspection engineers with a new, cost effective inspection
  tool that increases number of inspections, and quality, whilst minimising
  health and safety risks.  Dhalion is an autonomous inspection platform for
  wind turbines.  At the press of a button Dhalion allows existing O&M teams to
  complete wind turbine inspections in minutes rather hours with increased
  inspection quality.  The path is optimised for optimum coverage, reliability
  in weather and consistent data acquisiton. Throughout the flight Dhalion minds
  its surrounding and deals intelligently with obstacles and unexpected
  situations.
