    "description": "The world needs a clean and reliable source of base-load energy to develop sustainably into the future. That’s what Tokamak Energy is striving to achieve.  Tokamak Energy is a private company accelerating the development of fusion power.  It is now acknowledged that the spherical tokamak design offers the smallest and most cost-effective solution. This is our solution. Yet there are many complex engineering challenges that need to be overcome for demonstration and commercialisation of this technology.    Our team of world-class fusion scientists and magnet engineers is tackling these challenges to develop efficient and affordable fusion power. Our unique approach is centred on rapid innovation using the latest materials and technology – but building on decades of scientific research and experience. This strategy gives us – and the world – a faster way to fusion.",
