    "description": "Vay is a Berlin-based deep technology company that is on track to launch the first driverless, safety-certified, commercial fleet on European public streets. Starting this year. Unique about Vay is its teledrive-first approach to autonomous driving.  Vay’s fleet of vehicles is already operating with safety drivers across all of Berlin today. Recent technological and regulatory advancements will allow Vay to remove the safety driver from its vehicles this year.  Thomas von der Ohe, Fabrizio Scelsi, and Bogdan Djukic founded Vay in September 2018. Their team combines the best of two worlds - software and product experience from Silicon Valley and automotive hardware & safety engineering from Europe. Vay’s team members have previously worked at companies such as Tesla, Google, Waymo, Zoox, Byton, Argo, Amazon, Uber as well as Audi, BMW, and Daimler, and have founded various companies before.  Vay has raised over 100m USD from leading VCs such as Coatue, Kinnevik, Eurazeo, Atomico, Creandum, LaFamiglia, System.One, Visionaries Club, Signals as well as business angels Patrick Pichette (Partner at Inovia Capital, chairman of the board at Twitter, former global CFO at Google), Cristina Stenbeck (Board member of Spotify, chairman of the board at Zalando), Qasar Younis (co-founder and CEO of Applied Intuition, former COO and Partner of Y Combinator), and Formula 1 champion Nico Rosberg. The company has offices in Berlin, Germany, and Portland.",
