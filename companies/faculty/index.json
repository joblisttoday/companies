    "description": "Faculty was founded in 2014 by Marc, Angie and Andrew. The business started out with the fellowship to train and transition PhD and postdoc scientists into professional data scientists. Fellows would work on eight-week real world projects with a range of companies.  While collaborating with these companies we were asked to work on bigger and bigger projects, so we developed our services to deliver professional data science strategy, software and skills training.  In 2016, recognising the need for bespoke software, we built Faculty Platform to speed up AI deployment and increase the transparency and oversight over machine learning models.  Faculty now has Europeâ€™s most experienced team of AI and ML specialists, able to support any organisation to make AI real.",
