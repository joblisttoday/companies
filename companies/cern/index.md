  Physicists and engineers at CERN use the world's largest and most complex
  scientific instruments to study the basic constituents of matter â€“ fundamental
  particles. Subatomic particles are made to collide together at close to the
  speed of light. The process gives us clues about how the particles interact,
  and provides insights into the fundamental laws of nature. We want to advance
  the boundaries of human knowledge by delving into the smallest building blocks
  of our universe.  (Video: CERN) The instruments used at CERN are purpose-built
  particle accelerators and detectors. Accelerators boost beams of particles to
  high energies before the beams are made to collide with each other or with
  stationary targets. Detectors observe and record the results of these
  collisions.
