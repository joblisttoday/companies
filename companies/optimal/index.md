  We are a collection of engineers from Palantir, DeepMind, Oxford University
  and Cambridge University, on a mission to grow safer, healthier food by
  deploying fully autonomous greenhouses outside every city on earth. High-tech
  greenhouses are key to our agricultural future - for improving human nutrition
  and for securing our food system against climate change and population growth.
  We are doing everything we can to accelerate the deployment of new farms
  around the world. We are backed by leading deep technology VC funds, including
  Founders Fund, who backed companies such as SpaceX, Palantir and Square from
  the start.
