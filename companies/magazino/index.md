  We are Magazino, a robotics company based in Munich, Germany. We develop
  software and build robots that work together with people – autonomously,
  safely and at a level of navigation and manipulation that nobody before us has
  reached. This enables us to offer solutions for processes that could not
  previously be automated and to create intralogistics solutions that are more
  flexible and efficient than ever before. Our perception-driven robots are
  deployed in several warehouses and factories in Europe and solve real customer
  problems. With over 110 employees we’re one of the biggest
  Advanced-Robotics-Teams.  At Magazino, we're passionate about robotics and are
  always looking for like-minded individuals to help us achieve our lofty goals.
