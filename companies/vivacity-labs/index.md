  At Vivacity, our vision is to make cities smarter, safer and more sustainable.
  Our AI sensors and ‘Smart Junctions’ signal control gather detailed and
  anonymous data 24/7 on transport modes, traffic flow and travel patterns,
  supporting strategic decisions to help optimise the transport network and
  improve urban infrastructure.  Vivacity was awarded the Queen’s Enterprise
  Award for Innovation in 2021, and our sensors have been deployed in over 60
  towns and cities across the UK - with international growth well underway.  We
  are passionate about the protection of personal data and our sensors have been
  developed using privacy-by-design principles to ensure that personal data is
  never compromised.
