  Founded in 2015, Everledger is an independent technology company helping
  businesses surface and converge asset information, using a symphony of secure
  technologies, including blockchain, artificial intelligence, intelligent
  labelling and Internet of Things. Our purpose is to contribute greater clarity
  and confidence in marketplaces where transparency matters most.   We digitally
  streamline our clients’ compliance processes, to help them demonstrate the
  lifetime story of an asset with greater efficiency and accuracy. As technology
  partners, we also support in powering resilience and sustainability. With
  information out in the open, we believe the value of many industries – from
  diamonds, to fine wines, to e-recycling – will be shared by all stakeholders
  throughout the value chain.
