  Ieso is a world leading digital health company specialising in internet
  enabled evidence-based psychological therapies.  Our unique modality of
  providing online therapy through written conversation, along with our strict
  adherence to disorder-specific treatment protocols, means that we can ensure
  patients are experiencing the best possible evidence-based cognitive
  behavioural therapy (CBT) for their needs.  Using our proprietary technology,
  augmented with natural language processing and artificial intelligence, we can
  amplify therapy outcomes for patients while providing personalised training
  and supervision for therapists. This generates higher recovery rates and
  better outcomes for patients, while also delivering cost savings for the wider
  health economy.
