  We believe in a world where transport will be safe, green and available to
  all. A world where people will be free to pursue their dreams without the need
  to drive.  We started out building our own high-functioning, complete
  autonomous vehicle system and successfully testing it on London’s public
  roads. We then went on to lead the government backed StreetWise trials, widely
  thought to be the most complex AV trials completed publicly in Europe. In
  doing so our team began solving some of the industry’s greatest challenges.
