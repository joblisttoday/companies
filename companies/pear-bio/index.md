description: >-
  Pear Bio is a computational biology company that uses organ-on-a-chip and
  computer vision technology to recreate, visualize and compute the human tumor
  microenvironment and its effects on cancer progression. We are building an
  atlas of cancer progression to help research hospitals/pharma test
  experimental drugs and to help clinicians evaluate potential treatment options
  for each patient to improve outcomes. Our technology is applicable across
  solid tumors and we are currently working on a pipeline of biomarker negative
  cancers, with triple negative breast cancer as the lead indication.
