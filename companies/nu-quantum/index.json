    "description": "A quantum of light is called a photon.  At Nu Quantum we make quantum devices which can emit and detect single-photons.  Our devices underpin those quantum systems which make single photons carry quantum information or interact in sophisticated ways, to arrive at a new era of communications, simulation, computing, sensing and metrology.",
