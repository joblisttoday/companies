  Improbable is dedicated to building powerful technology designed to help solve
  previously impossible problems and enable the creation of new realities. In
  gaming and entertainment, Improbable unlocks truly next-generation gameplay
  through virtual worlds of unprecedented scale, persistence and richness. In
  other industries, we hope to help answer critical questions through
  simulations that could lead to a better functioning world.  Our platform,
  SpatialOS, lets developers transcend the limits of regular computation,
  allowing swarms of servers running in the cloud to cooperate in order to
  simulate worlds far larger and more complex than any single server could.
