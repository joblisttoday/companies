  At Augmenta we’re on the mission of changing Agriculture by “smartly”
  automating the most critical agricultural operations, driving down costs, and
  improving crop performance.  Augmenta is a deep-tech company serving farmers
  and agricultural service providers with both intuitive and actionable
  solutions. Our company is the first in the sector globally, combining
  reliability with scalability. The technology is based on edge computing,
  multispectral computer vision, and AI to achieve an accurate perception of the
  farming environment (e.g. the canopy health) and automate tasks, such as
  fertilizer application. Our state-of-the-art machine learning tech and
  carefully designed hardware operate in real-time and the system "learns"​ the
  more it's used by the farmer. A typical farmer can increase his yield up to
  15%, reduce the number of chemical field inputs by up to 20% and increase the
  quality of his field's end-product by 15%.  We are a diverse, agile, and cool
  team of top performers situated in different locations in Europe and the US.
  We care about each other, and our Culture & Values are immensely important for
  us. Trust is at the very heart of how we work; we have no fine print.
