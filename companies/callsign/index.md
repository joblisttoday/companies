description: >-
  Often innovative solutions focus on the capability of technology and do not
  give applicability to a user base the same weighting. Our engineering team
  comes from a banking and ecommerce background, with over 300 years combined
  experience in making software work for all. That’s why we are chosen to help
  some of the world’s largest banks and, offer the same “bank grade”
  identification solutions to public and private sector clients of all sizes. 
  Callsign helps your users get on with their digital lives in the most seamless
  way possible – checked, verified and safe, because we enhance, rather than
  block, user experience.
